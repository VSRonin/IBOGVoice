## Missing Voices Pack for AoE2:DE Mod Interactive Build Order Guides

This is a voice pack for [Cicero's Interactive Build Order Guide](https://buildorderreference.com/mods.html) mod for Age of Empires II Definitive Edition.
The voices are not as good as ZeroEmpire's dubbing but they get the job done.
This will not overwrite the existing sounds, just add the missing ones.

To install, just download IBOG.Missing.Voices.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/VSRonin/IBOGVoice/releases/latest) and unpack it into the sounds folder of the mod.
For the Steam version of the game, the folder structure should be something like `C:\Users\<user name>\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE\<random number>\mods\subscribed\2359_Interactive Build Order Guide\resources\_common\drs\sounds`

I hope i filled all the missing voices but if you notice any missing let me know by [opening a tiket](https://github.com/VSRonin/IBOGVoice/issues)
